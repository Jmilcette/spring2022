1. In `floatexpt.md` design an experiment using the `fractions.Fraction` class in python that shows helps illustrate how `.1*3 == .3` evaluates to `False` but `.1*4 ==.4` evaluates to `True`. (practice/review)
1. Add a github action to build your jupyter book, using the course site as an example.  GitHub actions live in a hidden folder `.github`. (apply scripting knowledge,  practice with git, and make it render as a book automatically)
