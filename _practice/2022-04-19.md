1. (priorty) Compare the time of the following operations, investigate what the different operations do/not do, how do the three times compare? and hypothesize explanations in `timing.md`. Which times are constant vs variable? Which vary the most? least? Tip: use a script with loops and [see the options](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/time.1.html)and write output to a file (to test how these impact your work. *extension idea:* expand the level of detail to include more analysis on this, Try to find operations that increase the user vs system time.   You can use basic bash operations or programs you have from other courses )

1. Practice exploring the list of processes running on your computer and investigate how much resources different things you do on a regular basis use. Make some general observations In `kernelproc.md`.
