1. Write a C program to compare values as doubles and as float (single precision/32bit) to see that this comparison issue is related to the IEEE standard and is not language specific.  (to practice)
1. (priority) confirm that you can run the hardware simuator `HardwareSimulator` not `CPUEmulator` that we used before
