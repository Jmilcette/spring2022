1. Write a C program to compare values as doubles and as float (single precision/32bit) to see that this comparison issue is related to the IEEE standard and is not language specific.  Make notes and comparison around its behavior and include it in a code cell in  `cdouble.md`(to practice)
1. (priority) confirm that you can run the hardware simulator `HardwareSimulator` not `CPUEmulator` that we used before (we will use this in class )
