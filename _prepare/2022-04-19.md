1.  Check that your KWL is up to date with all [required rows](kwlmin) and add a section (`##`) below your chart in the same file (either `README` or `chart.md`) that summarizes what you think about computer systems.
1. (priorty) Read about [systems vs applications](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-system-software-and-application-software/) programming. Create `systemsprogramming.md` to summarize the difference and what skills would be diffrent. Which do you have more experience with? What experience do you have with the other?  (we will address this in class Thursday)
