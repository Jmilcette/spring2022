# Why take this class

*Oliver McLaughlin*
You should take this class if you want to know more about what your computer is doing. This class will help you better understand error messages and will teach you bash
scripting and git. I have not taken 411 yet but I hear this class is good to take before 411. I also believe this class is good to take before 305 because we use git a lot in that
class.
