# Why take this class

You should take this class if you want to know more about what your computer is doing. This class will help you better understand error messages and will teach you bash
scripting and git. I have not taken 411 yet but I hear this class is good to take before 411. I also believe this class is good to take before 305 because we use git a lot in that
class.

You should take this class if you want to get a headstart on your education and
career. This class covers quite a bit, but each topic is designed to give you
just enough so that you're not completely in the dark when you have to learn
this stuff for a class. Additionally, being comfortable with version control
systems is essential for not only school projects, but also your internships
and jobs.
