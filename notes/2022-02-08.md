## Can I reset a Git repository?


Find the hash number for the first commit of your in-class repo.
On your terminal, navigate to that repo.
Do: `git checkout <paste hash here>`
Look back at what happened.
Make a new branch called 'reset' and push that branch.
Switch back to the current version of the repo
In browser compare the two branches.

## Moving Files Requires Care


```
touch fa
echo "file one" > fa
cat fa
```

---
```
echo "file two" > fb
cat fb
```
----
```
mv fa fb
cat fb
```

## STDOut, Redirects and Echo

```
echo "some text" > a_file
cat a_file
```
and we get output as before

```
some text
```

That line has two new parts both `echo` and the `<` syntax.

```
echo "hello world"
```
```
hello world
```

```
echo "some text" > a_file
cat a_file
```

```
some text
echo "some text" >> a_file
cat a_file
some text
some text
man echo
echo "new prepend" > b_file
echo a_file >> b_file
cat b_file
new prepend
a_file
man echo
man echo
a_file >> b_file
-bash: a_file: command not found


|Name |	File descriptor	| Description|	Abbreviation|
|----|---|----|---|
Standard input |	0	|The default data stream for input, for example in a command pipeline. In the terminal, this defaults to keyboard input from the user.|	stdin |
| Standard output |	1| 	The default data stream for output, for example when a command prints text. In the terminal, this defaults to the user's screen.	| stdout |
| Standard error |	2| 	The default data stream for output that relates to an error occurring. In the terminal, this defaults to the user's screen.	| stderr |


```{important}
GitBash [does not support man](https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice/issues/249)
the reasons athe developer [does not want to](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/696) are also visible. You can use the help option `-help` try the help command.  
The help is slightly different from the man pages overall.

Alternatively, you can modify your environment further.
Enabling the Windows subsystem for Linux is one option. So is booting into Linux
[for example ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview)
that is installed on a flash drive. This uses the flas drive as the hard drive
for the operating system. This option creates 2 whole "computers" at the
software level, that use the same hardware.

## Prepare for Next Class

1. [install h/w simulator](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software)
1. Add a glossary, cheatsheet entry, or historical context/facts about the things we have learned to the site.
1. Review past classes prep/more practice and catchup if appropriate
1. Map out how you think about data moving through a small program

```{sidebar}
To contribute to the course site, use the suggest edit button (or go to the repo).

![screenshot of the site glossary with the "suggest edit" option under the GitHub menu at the top right selected](../img/suggest_edit.png)

You don't have edit permission, so it will have you create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks)
Make your edits and commit them to a new branch with agood name and commit message
as usual. Then [open a PR from your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
```

## Questions After class

### Can you echo multiple files at the same time?

### does this character "<" do something different than the redirect character ">"?
```{toggle}
They are both [redirections](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html) `<` is less common.
```



### When can we expect approved pull requests?
```{toggle}
Feedback hours mostly, which are 5-6pm on Tuesday and 4-5pm on Thursday
```

### What's under the hood with >? How do those work?
```{toggle}
There are some links about redirects above. We'll come back to it after we talk
through the overview of hardware a bit more in the next class.
```


### What happens if I don't meet the requirements for the grade I contract for?
```{toggle}
You will be able to revise the contract if you choose to earn a different grade.
The revision will also have to get approved, but it is an option. If you do not
fulfill your contract in the form it is stated at the end of the semester, you
will get an incomplete and then we will make a plan to change that to a letter.
```

### What level of understanding of the abstraction stack is typical for a programmer?
```{toggle}
This is going to depend on their training.  A person who programs after a short
coding bootcamp or a scientist who codes in order to do their scientific research
may only understnd the application and algorithm layers and be perfectly content
and able to fulfill their goals.  With a Computer Science degree we hope that by
the end you have down to Assembly very strong and the basic ideas down to gates/
registers.  Someone with a Computer Engineering degree will have more understanding
at the lower levels but maybe less in programming languages and alorithms than a
CS degree. My EE degree gave me really good understanding in the physics up to
microarchitectures and the alogorithms layers. I've learned more about the
middle layers in other places.
```


## Why you would want to override the name/path of a file?
```{toggle}
You probably would not want to do this very often, but for example, I do this
when I download a newer version of a file and my browser names the new version
something like `file_name (1).ext` I actually wanted to overwrite but it assumes
that I do not, so I use `mv file_name\ (1).ext file_name.ext` to overwrite the
new, updated content into the better file name (without the space and (1))
```

### How does Authentication on GitHub work?
```{toggle}
[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github) provides a whole page on that with advice and links.
We will also come back to this in order to talk about ssh keys and ssh generally
next week.
