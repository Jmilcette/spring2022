# What actually *is* git?

## Grading Contract Q & A

[Grading contract information is added to the syllabus]()

and the [FAQ]() section


## Git is a File System with a Version Control user interface

[git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem with a VCS user interface written on top of it.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain)



Porcelain: the user friendly VCS

Plumbing: the internal workings- a toolkit for a VCS


We have so far used git as a version control system.  A version control system, in general, will have operations like commit, push, pull, clone.  These may work differently under the hood or be called different things, but those are what something needs to have in order to



## Git is distributed


Git can have different workflows

![subversion workflow](https://git-scm.com/images/about/workflow-a@2x.png)



![integration manager workflow](https://git-scm.com/images/about/workflow-b@2x.png)



![dictator and lieutenants workflow](https://git-scm.com/images/about/workflow-c@2x.png)


```
cd path/to/sysinclass/
ls
```
and we're going to start by examinging our familiar github inclass repo

```
github-in-class-brownsarahm	nand2tetris
```

```
cd github-in-class-brownsarahm/
ls -a
```

```
.		.github		README.md	b_file		setup.py
..		CONTRIBUTING.md	a_file		docs		test_file.md
.git		LICENSE.md	about.md	mymodule	tests
```

```
cd .git
ls
```



```
COMMIT_EDITMSG	description	info		packed-refs
HEAD		hooks		logs		refs
config		index		objects
```

|name | type| purpose|
|-----|----|-----|
|objects | directory | the content for your database  |
| refs | directory | pointers into commit objects in that data (branches, tags, remotes and more)|
| HEAD | file | points to the branch you currently have checked out|
| index| file | stores your staging area information. |


```
cat HEAD
```



```
ref: refs/heads/main
```

This tells us where in the git history the current status of the repository is.  
This is what git uses when we call git status.



cd ..
git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	a_file
	b_file
	test_file.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

## Questions after class


### when should the grading contract be turned in?
```{toggle}
First draft is due Thursday, Feb 17 at 4pm as in the README
```

### Can you create multiple remotes that have the same name?
```{toggle}
no each remote has to have a different name, like each variable in a program has to be unique if you try to create a new remote with the same name it would overwrite the old one
```


### what does it mean when a branch is both x commits ahead of main, but also y commits behind?
```{toggle}
```


### Should we be working with Git entirely from the terminal for classwork or is it our preference?
```{toggle}
In class, we will use the terminal because it is the most consistent and transparent.  For other work, you can edit it however you like.  You can work in browser, with the GitHub desktop client, using the GitHub CLI, or your favorite IDE's tools. I recommend giving the terminal a serious try because it will have all of the features of git and other tools may not, but your preference is fine.  It could actually be really good for your general understanding to practice with git at least two ways.
```

### Will we be using the github cli to publish our repo to github?
```{toggle}
We are going to mostly use the base git CLI because it is more general and usable in more contexts (for example, your remote could be on GitLab or BitBucket or an internal private server)
```

### Questions we will answer in the next couple of classes

1. What is the purpose of the index file?
1. How do you add your local repo to github?
1. What would happen if we would change this hexadecimal code which is in the files in .git?
1. Are any more efficient ways to navigate through repositories and git files
