# How do represent non integer numbers?

- mini coverage of notebooks
- floating point
- IEEE double format


## When would you use the REPL with Python?

```{admonition} Additional context relative to class
:class: warning

I added here some additional context for using the notebook that I did not
mention explicitly in class.
```

One of the questions from [Tuesday](2022-04-05) was why would we ever use python in the terminal instead of by making .py files.  A Juptyer notebook
aims to balance the advantages of a file and working in the interpreter.

We work in our browser, and there are cells, some are Markdown.

```python
name = 'sarah'
```

```python
name
```

```bash

cat checker.sh
```

## What about a fixed point?

Let's experiment with an 8 bit representation with 1 bit for sign and then the next 4 used for the part of the  number greater than 0 and the last 3 for the frational part. 

so then the number: 
```
01000001
```
 would be 
 
```
0-1000-001
```
positive, 8.1 

in this thn we can represent the numbers 0-8 for the right hand side and 0-15 on the left hand side so we get

```python
num_list = [str(n+f) for n,f in itertools.product(range(16),[i/10 for i in range(10)])]
', '.join(num_list) + ', '.join(['-'+ n for n in num_list])
```

```python
len(num_list)*2
```

This is far fewer different values than we could represent with 1 bit for sign and 7 bits to represent intergers

```python
(2**7)*2
```

## Floating Point Notation

<!-- #region -->
We can write  numbers in many different forms. We have written integers through many different bases so far.


For example in scienfitic contexts, we often write numbers (in base 10) like: 

$$
3.45 \times 10^2 = 345
$$

## Floats don't equal themselves

```python
.1 + .1 + .1
```

```python
.1 + .1 + .1 == .3
```

```python
round(.1,1) + round(.1,1) + round(.1,1) == round(.3,1)
```

```python
round(.1 + .1+ .1 ,1)
```

```python
.1
```

```python
num = .1
```

```python

## Floating point IEEE standard


[IEEE Floating Point ](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8766229)
is what basically everyone uses, but it is technically a choice hardware manufacturers can techically make. 


- Initially in 1985
- Reviesd in 2008 after 7 year process that expanded
- revised in 2019 after 4 year process that mostly clarified


*IBM mainframes use their own representiton based on Hex*


Next revision is projected to 2028.

this is a double precision float or binary64 inthe current standard.  

it was called double in the original, offiically, so it is commonly called that.

In this case we will 1 bit for sign, 11 for exponent and 52 for the fraction part

![float bit image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/IEEE_754_Double_Floating_Point_Format.svg/2560px-IEEE_754_Double_Floating_Point_Format.svg.png)

### How do we read a number like this?

if the sign bit is $s$ and the number represented by the exponent bits is $e$ and the 52 bits are number from right most is 0 and the last one is 52. 


$$
(-1)s + \left(1 + \sum_{i=1}^{52} b_{52-i} 2^{-i}\right) \times 2^{e-1023}
$$

Note that this is $2^{-1}$ so we are working with *fractions* instead of integers in the sum. 

So if we had: 

```
0 01111111111 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
it would represent: 
$$ (-1)*0 + \left(1 + 0\cdot 2^{-0} + 0\cdot 2^{-1} + \ldots  + 0\cdot 2^{-51) + 0\cdot 2^{-52) \times 2^{1023-1023} = 0 + (1 + 0) \times 2^0  = 1 \times 1 =  1.0$$


or
```
0 01111111111 0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

it would represent: 
$$ (-1)*0 + \left(1 + 0\cdot 2^{-0} + 1\cdot 2^{-1} + \ldots  + 0\cdot 2^{-51) + 0\cdot 2^{-52) \times 2^{1023-1023} = 0 + (1 + \frac{1}{2}) \times 2^0  = 1.5 \times 1 =  1.5 $$

```

```python

```

```python

```

### How do we get numbers into this form? 

First we take the sign of the number for the sign bit, but then to get the exponent and fraction, we have more work to do.  

Let's take the equation we had from the standard: 

$$  \left(1 + \sum_{i=1}^{52} b_{52-i} 2^{-i}\right) \times 2^{e-1023}$$ 

Let's convert the number represented by the bits to a single decimal number, since we raise the bits to negative powers of 2 instead of positive, we can say that this number is a fraction


$$\frac{1}{10} ~= \frac{ J }{2^N}$$

$$J ~= 2^N / 10$$
<!-- #endregion -->

 Since we want to use exactly 53 bits to represent $J$, we want $\frac{2^N }{10}$ to be greater than or equalt to $2^{52}$ and less than $2^{53}$. 
 
 $$ 2^{52} <= \frac{2^N }{10} < 2^{53} $$
 
 Since $10 =8+2 =  2^3 +2^1$ then $2^3<10<2^4$
 We can say that 
 $$ \frac{2^N }{2^4} < \frac{2^N }{10} < \frac{2^N }{2^3} $$
 
 $$ 2^{N-4} <  \frac{2^N }{10} < 2^{N-3} $$
 
 so if we want:
 
 $$ 2^{52} <= \frac{2^N }{10} < 2^{53} $$
 
then best $N$ is 56, but we can check it. 

```python
2**52 <= 2**56 //10 < 2**53
```

Now we can get the number we will use for $J$. We want to get as close to .1 with our fraction as possible, so 

```python
q,r = divmod(2**56,10)
```

```python
r
```

```python
q+1
```

```python
len(bin(q+1))-2
```

```python
bin(q+1)
```

0b1 1001 1001 1001 1001 1001 1001 1001 1001 1001 1001 1001 1001 1010

```python
bin(1023+56)
```

```python
float.hex(.1)
```

```python
2**-4
```

```python
(q+1)/2**56
```

```python
(q+1)/2**56 == .1
```

```python
format(.1, '.17f')

Jupyter book will be able to run it even if you don't separately install jupytext, but you need the jupytext to generate it automatically.
