# What *is* a computer?


- how, physically, do we get the components we have seen?
- what other components do we need?
- how are those implemented


How have computers changed over time?

- at the physical level
- what was the context and motivation for these advances?
- how does that context influence how we use computers today?
- how does that influence computing as a discipline?


## Let's start with a dictionary



[we can start with a dictionary](https://www.oed.com/oed2/00045995)

- note that this starts with reference to a person.



### Computers as people

 and this text this particular dictionary is useful because it also includes where does the term originated like where does in that particular usage start appearing and so these are these are pretty all right this is starting 1646 1707

- Use of the word computer to refer to the person still common how recently  1950s
- the movie [hidden figures](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/) is available on Disney+ with subscription or other streaming platforms for ~$4 streaming rental.
- the book [hidden figures](https://uri-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/10nopmq/01URI_ALMA21128298920002396) is available at URI's library

 <!-- I know you're not in that you've seen it can you tell us a little bit about that movie

it was it was yeah to get a person to the Moon requires a lot of math right like rockets all of that it's a lot of math for that to happen

 NASA's initial setup computers



 was rooms full of people with small talk to you later and they were doing all the calculations were being paid the jobs they were doing the

 the computers in to take it over and do the actual like get the numbers out yes that was a next question so women were computers man were mathematicians if women went to college and got like a bachelor's degree in math they could then we'll be a computer and work

 what the mathematicians were all men about time which is not pleasant I feel like cringing discomfort like tensions but that's what the women were computers that's all the way

 because when NASA and other places started buying actual physical machine computers people who have been doing the calculations were then taught to



part of that movie's plot is that they got the computer and then they actually the first ones who became proficient with those particular computer is on that particular site in Virginia and the others left, and all that stuff but

 -->


### Computers as Machines
 computer starts to be termed talking about a machine must later so that 1897 is a long time after 1646

you like ideas

 most of them are physical really things like you can see there's a couple things early but most of it starts around 1944 46 around then what was going on



they weren't ya so early computer people were mathematicians by like training and their own identity but then they kind of blurred into things too the world was very dark place and it is today they're worried about

 other like it was a lot of applications it was also like the Manhattan Project was one of the things that motivated them like this is why we need to build a lot of calculations and then later at the end of the 56 the Moon that was also a lot of math like we need to make sure these Rockets can like go up and come back down the way we expect them to




### How much do we talk about computers?

[how much do we talk about them changes over time ](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=7&case_insensitive=on&content=computer&direct_url=t4%3B%2Ccomputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bcomputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BComputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BCOMPUTER%3B%2Cc0#t4%3B%2Ccomputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bcomputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BComputer%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BCOMPUTER%3B%2Cc0)


how much do we have to talk about them so Google does this thing with Google Books

it's me what's surprising about that surprising

if you talk to you not the

is there talk about things when they're new

- note that we talk about things a lot using their basic name when they're new
- we don't talk about normal things

 hey I think things are trained on news Corporal and do not like otech bodies of news text from the internet

 they would consider murder a very high frequency and blinking very low frequency of that

 don't talk about blinking we do it all the time like I'm sure since I started talking with my king every one of us has blank more than once

## Mechanical Calculators
 how do we actually like physically make it be machine



 well we've we've talked we handed out that like it's going to reduce down to or isn't my check and logical operations write those de back much further than


 ![pascal](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Pascaline-CnAM_823-1-IMG_1506-black.jpg)



 what is the mechanical calculator it works by like incrementing it doesn't do the logic like they took not a binary representation it's not adding via input two numbers and then it goes forward its where's my income as you put in one number then you can add the next number and it kind of works the wheels have like the numbers on them and it uses like 9 supplement to carry over to the next bit so there's a gear that when it hits a certain point that turns the next year and then it goes for it any Castles in the Sky why the semi did


**Why did he make this?**

He was 18 and  his father was a tax commissioner in France and he wanted to like reduce his father's workload

 so he invented this calulator machine and received roayl privilege from France in 1649 to be only person allowed to build a manufactured Computing a calculator is like mechanical calculators

```{note}
Contrast this royal privelege with the 1970s where in resolving some other conflict, a court that declared the content of the computer that they cannot be found it at all and it's free for anyone to use the concept of a computer
```


##  How did this change over time?



calculators that are still analog so they're still working with mechanical systems using Waze electricity becomes easier

 we can start doing like electrical signal processing so we can move analog signals and start doing our agents and calculations with those are not what was really used through for transmitting information like telegram telephone all of that is analog thing



 family is a point where they start noticing their similarities between Springs and dampers



 like the mechanical things are used to build these mechanical calculators and the electrical components so resistors transistors all these things Anatomy start getting electrical computers I'm so

 we're going to use that some pieces of this time out of computing from the Computer History Museum I'm going to caveat that like there are
[timeline of computing](https://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/computers/)



 1937 we got this call the model k demonstration for an adder

 I have a spot that I did not turn off the sounds on my apologize this is a telephone relays so these are I told him he lays this was called about okay because he did that he took some pieces at home from work home and like Delta side of kitchen table. This basic thing working

 it can do for addition and he's a telephone relay switch or an electromechanical switch so they're using like a telephone system like the old one not our current system is is now different originally they're using telephone system so like repeat and relay a signal so you get it I'm coming soon do you want to transmit it to the next wire to move it along so for example if you wanted to call from here to California you would go from your house to the first real a outfit that the signal would be manually by a person transmit it like or lift it over to the next section of cable it'll go some distance and then go to the next and then the next in the next we have to be relayed over and he's relays are electromagnetic signal things that weigh

this model K calculator

 was used for a couple other things and modeled into the basic idea one of which was this complex number calculator which was at Bell Labs so the person that built this

 George stepsiblings he did not mention he use that complex number calculator

 he demonstrated how this works in combination with Telegraph

 for the first remote access

eventually but it's in New York City at the time and Hanover New Hampshire and he use a telegraph to do remote calculations on this calculator and bring them the numbers back

 so this way were using literally like this is how big it takes to do for a bit

 addition

what time we switch how we built the gate some dogs



 I have lost oh I know it is so one of the things that was in the prepare for next class Celeste

We can build an adder mechanically with marbles and wood

 circuits are electricity even you can have these this basic idea of his logic is the best part of the power of whatever operations we need using this obstruction of his flipping back and forth with simple mechanical things we can see with more complex electromechanical things or we can men start producing it down so we're modern computers are built with

 first they were these diets or will vacuum tubes in the diodes or sort of delayed there they're very close in time but these are not the other if you can put a bunch of those together some kind of light switches you can put them together you put them together you can get the kids and then you put the games together to get the larger calculations

 Kraken Peters Eastern sisters and so with that relies on his instead of mechanical things switching or just electricity going on and off it's a conductor so it's using like Material Science level behavior of electromagnetic so you have materials that do funny things

 getting all of your stuff you don't have to know the details of it but that's what happened there's like some nonlinear interactions in the physical device

 and that's how we're able to get you know computers that are thin and small and phones and all these things over time so it's still using the same basic concept of like that gate just let me know something back and forth all you need is a switch when you put it on together you can get them more complex calculations

 so

 to get a whole computer what else do we need besides we talked about how to do addition



 we need a hotel you right I mention there's a little bit more than just the addition that we seen

 so we can

 let me tell you



 and see what else

 it does so this

 is a weird visual representation someone to walk you through it and then encourage you to try it out practice with it later so this is a specific value that represents a point in time and not done there's like a set of switches at the top to pick the operations and then there's like a number here but then maps to where that input like this input goes to here and here and here and here

so if for example well it's already set to add so that makes some of these locations on and that turns that makes this circuit do addition so we put a number in here let's see what we got ones to choose fours

 I don't know why that's labeled as far as it should be eight

 we can put a number in so we have one and 0 it's going to get one make it one and one we get to can I get free into when we get four as expected so we can then switch



switch the circuit to do different things between the numbers so this would get us bitwise operations of an indoor and outdoor on our numbers

 I'm getting off on the gate so if we

the gate

then we're doing

the right number

 but should be 23 - 152



what apartment number I don't know why

 I guess they say that some things could be incorrect and this is one of them Peter Wright the visit I don't know why they didn't fix this to be the right thing

 but

 with a few controls and the outer that we saw you can get addition subtraction multiplication division and comparisons Otto's

 l u





what else do we need besides ALU for to have like a whole computer

Christian

like for like a week and look at it we need some sort of outfits what else Tyler



we eventually need clocks to time things and synchronize things to like know when to clear and when to change so that you if you want to do multiple things in sequence you can do that what else you need or want to do multiple things in sequence but don't know what else we need a general now

 yeah you might need to store more than just like the two inputs and you might need to store a sequence of instructions

 so

 my diagram didn't work so the basic architecture we used to talk about all the main component we need is called the Von Neumann architecture this is a slightly expanded version of it could be slightly simpler than this but

 theater image put the volume in architecture

 was from 1945 was written by people at 10 and this is basically how we still design computers for the most part we have you control unit

 some memory and some registers together all of these things or the CPU

 these can talk to Ram which is memory random-access memory so this is a memory that can be changed any time we want it Amanda storage or hard drive which is now not as physically different from these two but that's there

 why do you differentiate memory that can be

 random access memory what's the alternative

say we have Ram Is Random Access we can access it whenever we want we can read it right it but what's the alternative to ran no and what does that stand for

 read only

 read-only memory is all they actually had and the very first several computers we go back to our history at these points these are all read-only any memory they have

 is read-only

 Rama Rama Ram

eventually like that play 80s 90s

 ROM

 so this 19:45 is the first the draft of that the concept of that this this diagram had here just a concept of separating things out and having a programmable computer Steven program by can change what it could do was 1945

 we had the first program later this eniac computer

 which athlete came out certainty 43 wasn't finished for a little while this this all this is one computer and see there's several people in this room doing this one computer this was programmed manually like changing the circuits because it helped me had and that point in time they only had read-only memory you could put something into memory we don't have memory like what kind of memory that you could keep when you said the power off for a long time what's the powers off then what was that whatever was in Army was on and all we had was just reading the numbers you could program the computer stuff is working out to do the thing we're going to do and then you could go do that calculation many times you needed an Ordy bug a program that it took weeks to value of all experience the pain of debugging rarely it takes two weeks to debug one error correct

 right yes maybe it hurts sometimes it's like a long night not enough sleep but like this week's of like moving cables did anyone get his memory we need some way about you storing things and writing things down and we need a way that actually can store memory that first they do more vacuum tubes do the same sort of switching on and off with store stuff but the problem with that is the power off

 so but this

 stored program computers they only had read only memory and eventually we got random access memory which we could write and read and change whenever we wanted

 which we can have including storage without power

 so and not but we have three types of places we store information we got registers which store information that is currently being processed so we look back at our circuits these inputs here we're turning onto just as B were treating them as switches but these are actually implemented as register if you have a register at the input and a register register the input for each of the inputs to b l u r i a registered but it's only live it's got some number of bits in it so see if you're paying attention and putting things together we talked about a computer system having like operating doing some type of some type of a b s what device stores that many bits

Dell computers we have

so what what is Ashley's what is the thing that has that number of bits is a limitation of the device equipment stores at me I guess I should have changed the options but we'll go look what it is



 so if the are you taking a vacation from registers can write its memory usage just for long-term storage we talked about computer being certain regrets what is what type of story is that many bits

 I thought close there we go almost everyone



 give me the registers feel you with all that has to be compatible with the same number of beds so I realize I should have not fail you and CPU there because of CPU contains the registers and hail you so that was a poorly written by the registers is what has in a bit so our current computers have what size registers it's most common 64 presentation that's assuming we got 64-bit registers



 we can do sir and calculations on your bed so we talked about a lot of Portland python including other programs they don't there's no overflow it just uses another type but that's going to have to use like to I can't do directly in one step use the ale you to add two numbers that can be represented in 54. Its it has to like use memory and pull them back and forth and nothing works is with addition addition is always like you can have the pieces together and you can start with the place has been at the next ones and it's a Time keep track what you didn't put them together so the registers are that and then the registers have the same the hell you would have one pin or like one connection for each bit in a register

once you have random access memory now we can start to have more complicated computers and so the first kind of way they talked about this is that you could start to have things like Liquors in the Tyler's house the computer be used to do the programming the programming was not something you did away from the computer and then you brought it to the computer anymore once you got Random Access Memory once you can put things in

 and change them around inside you can start having programs I can do higher level operations so

 one of the ways this was first described

 when they were saying they look good look at his school today we can do was it called if they have programs I could write programs

 right they could have gone with the right program so it's still just not there's a program that could like change it from the high-level language to write it into like the instructions at now when someone says you have a coronavirus program what are they referring to

 write the song about a tire machine learning of some sort of machine learning really often wear like you got an algorithm

 that's taking data and it's outputting another hour though

Norma call what would you like the regular basic simple program you do a program that to write programs anymore that's not how we use that word anymore but it changed over time and how it's used okay so who's now gone from have a lot of gates went down and talked about like how did he physically exists and then we went and brought her back out to the volume in architecture and got kind of a big basic components

 now we have the basis of old computer and will be out of the rest of the week on this mess we've talked about how do we get from high-level programming languages down to instructions

 please confirm details in certain places but you've got all the pieces you've got the tools are gone through the survey of that we've got to the hardware will talk about how it's physically exist

when I was talking about it so

 I started asking questions after some classes that are

 when will I use this I've answered most of your questions to the best of my ability but when I want to give you the opportunity now let's take a moment and share with me any questions you would want to ask a developer who works out in the street cuz they're going to be very different experience and I have like I have not Evergreen production code

 I have not worked in a for-profit corporation in a lot of years

 I know people to do so I can seem to find them so I could do some mixture of inviting some to talk in class and or



 using that to help me figure out what like has lots of developers write blogs and stuff for like right things and I can't use those for you and for the future so what kind of questions what would you want to ask a developer working industry or would you want open them I'll give you a couple minutes to think about that

you can send multiple as well and I will use these altogether too



play see driving slowed all things have been signed

 so we have to some depth covered the most important topics to cover for this course so

 help me decide how I want to balance the rest of the time you so I'm going to let those of you who chose to come to class today give me your input

 so is there anything or what that you were hoping to get from his class that you've not seen yet or something you want to review more detail what other topics or things do you want to understand

I know this is because some of the like the initial top it will be like outlined how long different types would take

 certain things I eat like we thought would take a lot longer if most of you retain things from like Math 180 and so like I didn't have to spend as much time as like a number system cuz you like kind of all got my questions right away and I'll send two classes on that because

 you all got the questions right so we're good we have a little bit of time to play with and we can



 go back over or exploited for directions I can of course fill the time I'm not saying there'd be no classes but I might as well use your your opinions to balance that out

that is rough that is rough

 yeah I had a professor in my electronics class which is like



 made a deal with it exactly like understand the physics of how like an op-amp like an individual components and upward like how the physics with any device works it's not very fun class I did not enjoy it like we have this weird classroom with stairs and then like they are desperate on a platform around the u-shape and there's some people sitting on the floor in the middle and he was passing her mid-term and he slipped on the stairs and fell and then like an emt's were coming and they wanted to take him to the hospital seems like an 80 year old man or somebody I don't know he was very old

 while he watched. I watched him in the hospital like

he's watching them about their exam because a seven-year-old man falls down stairs and is bleeding from the head like he needs to go to the hospital but he refused

you know we were all over like we just you just took the exam like quietly finished it up and like guard nice little 40 hours or whatever we because they were always like that and then the next class he wasn't there and we were all panicked he was fine he came back with the following week but it was very weird exam



there's a that is alright so

 k c

 sundancers if you have more things you can fill it in later



I'm going to



how do I regular I keep forgetting to put these questions in my notes

 so what is one thing you learned today

I can get her is very angry and I might not make it till 1:45 we're going to hope for the best this is what I get for not charging my laptop and not using it until I come to class what is one question you have

one question I'm going to answer

 start with I think is more commonly used than others yes we actually don't need any Gates other than and

 soda nand is this one in here so it's not an so they're both zero it's their it's one if either one is one it stays one and it's zero when they're both one we can actually use man gates to implement every other gate all you need is Nan Gates

 which because of the scale of manufacturing makes it actually cheaper than many of its it ends up being cheaper to just use almond and Gates even though it's technically slightly slower



 it's way cheaper and what the time and got to slow up fast enough than the difference does it matter until we actually can even give him everything he's the only man and then it ends up being for like four level like design people are actually playing with her little things they just only stopped navigate to see if you can buy like a million of one thing instead of like having six different types of things and you didn't you need to know like what ratio of the one you need you don't get it out of his price so they just only reason I ended





do certain applications are for example

 like if you're times you like streaming calculations where you want to do something online I'll make you something in real time people will do one like radios are often actually like an only very very recently was a digital radio actually worth it right we could have done it a long time ago but the envelope was so much faster that it was better but you can do people use fpgas which is a field programmable

 but I keep forgetting to get around like I forgot to get away but it's it's a piece of Hardware that you can like flash



 into making it be specific specific sequence of gates and then you can it'll Implement things like in real-time so because this is going to be way like having just one either way slowed down but having like a specified circuit that does the one calculation you want is going to be faster than using a nail you in sequence to do each step cuz you have to thank you for asking you what I mean that's like this by Newman

 architecture do you have to put instruction calculation that's like I'd be three numbers in a row and then multiply them or whatever right so you have to

 set the control unit to do each to each of those control signal to multiply set the two registers that are going into the ale u21 number the next Monday to take the number from the output of the register put it back to the input to the next side and then I the next number and I'm not going to be way slower here and then I want to do the next where is if you have 11 circuit that's like 3 hours in a sequence I need to set the numbers on the registers and it goes out to be the alpha right away will be much faster in time so we will talk more to get rid of how to say some of those things in a class I will add more subsidence but one thing

 does any part of your prepare for that class is there's this article from Communications of the ATM so they want you to read

 it sounds like the most recent volume this month about different systems instructions

 I have some questions for you to think about now that you've talked to a lot of these topics we're going to start doing some more things that are not only like here's another new little bit but here out of these things come back together and how does it relate back to the bigger picture to help you really retain all the things we learn cuz if you'd like just to be able to think of sequence it's easy to forget I know that you know that I don't want you to forget the things that are important they were going to start putting together in ways to help you retain what they learn

 and we will end and I will see you next week



 remember to update your grade in contacts
