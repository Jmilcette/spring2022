# Advice to future students
To get the most out of CSC 392, students should come to class where there are in class activites to practice the content learned. Going over the notes is also a great
way to refresh students with the subjects. Although students are given the ability to do work on their own time with the only due date being the end of the semester, I
would advise everyone to start on their work at their soonest convenience. I did not always start on work the same week due to other work and outside responsibilities
but working on this course work early was always better than doing it later. When you start early you are able to dive deeper into the course contents and have a better
learning experience.
